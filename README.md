## DBA overview

The pipeline of our framework consists of two steps:
1. Injecting adversarial samples to train the classification model.
2. Training a simple multi-layer perceptron (MLP) classifier to judge whether the sample is adversarial.

We take MNIST and CIFAR as examples: the mnist_undercover_train.py and cifar_undercover_train.py refer to the step one; the mnist_DBA.ipynb and cifar_DBA.ipynb refer to the step two.
